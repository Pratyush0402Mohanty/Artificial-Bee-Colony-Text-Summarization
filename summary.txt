There are 65 Million girls out of school across the globe; majority of them are in the developing and underdeveloped countries.If we consider society as tree, then men are like its strong main stem which supports the tree to face the elements and women are like its roots; most important of them all.The stronger the roots are the bigger and stronger the tree will be spreading its branches; sheltering and protecting the needy.Women are the soul of a society; a society can well be judged by the way its women are treated.An educated man goes out to make the society better, while an educated woman; whether she goes out or stays at home, makes the house and its occupants better.They are more compassionate towards the needs of others and have a better understanding of social structure.They have to have the weapon of education to carve out a progressive path for their own as well as their families.
